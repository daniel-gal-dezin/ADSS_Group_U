In our system, we have successfully integrated two key modules—the stock Module and the Delivery Module—by leveraging a centralized database to manage inventory quantities.
The stock Module is responsible for maintaining accurate inventory levels by updating quantities whenever stock is received or sold.
Concurrently, the Delivery Module interacts with the same database to adjust inventory levels based on delivery operations,
ensuring that items are deducted from the stock when deliveries are dispatched. This seamless integration allows both modules to operate cohesively,
providing real-time updates to inventory quantities and ensuring data consistency across the system. By synchronizing data between these modules through the database,
we achieve efficient inventory management and operational transparency, which are crucial for our business processes.
